This is a proof-of-concept research project, illustrating how to synthesize
hardware machine check exceptions for processor exploitation and privilege
escalation.


## Coming Soon

The described issue is not yet fully mitigated; a complete toolset will be
released in the near future, including:

* Machine check synthesis kernel module
* MCA bank exploration utilities
* Northbridge MCE fuzzer
* End-to-end exploitation toolset
* Exploit payload

Stay tuned.
